The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics. Here are the key points about it:
Dataset Structure:

Contains 150 samples total (50 samples from each of 3 iris species)
Features measured: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width (all in centimeters)
Species: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris Versicolor

Key Characteristics:

Size and Balance: The dataset is perfectly balanced with 50 samples per class, making it ideal for learning classification techniques.
Feature Relationships:

One species (Setosa) is linearly separable from the other two
Versicolor and Virginica have some overlap and are more challenging to separate
Petal measurements tend to be more discriminative than sepal measurements


Historical Significance:

Introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936
Data collected by Edgar Anderson
Became a benchmark dataset for testing machine learning algorithms



Common Uses:

Teaching basic data visualization techniques
Demonstrating classification algorithms
Introducing concepts of feature selection and dimensionality
Testing new machine learning methodologies
